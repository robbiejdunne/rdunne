I am a journalist and Data Science student. I am in

I didn’t have a place where I could publish a lot of the writing and tinkering I do so I created a website to host it.

If you care to know what I’ve read or am currently reading, you might want a gander at my bookshelf. If you have any questions, want to chat about one of my posts or need help getting started, you can find me over on Twitter.

Hang Dai!
